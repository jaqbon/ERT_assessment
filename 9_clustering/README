I worked on the clustering for a bit, but didn't come up with anything that I
liked. It seems like the typical procedure is to try lots of algorithms, with
lots of guesses for the number of clusters, and see what looks good. I did
try a hierarchal algorithm, since I already had the code from an earlier,
work-related project, but I didn't get any results that looked interesting.

I began with a basic examination of the data, and simply plotted the variables
against one another. I took logs to deal with the large numbers.

There is definitely high-level structure. Tthe plot for the first variable, x0,
shows that it seems to split into two distinct regions. Also, there seems to be
a linear relationship (in log space) between x0 and variables x1 and x3.

The x1 plot also indicates a linear relationship between x1 and a3. There seems
to be no relationship between x1 and x2 or x4.

The variabel x2 splits is possibly split into three (four?) regions. There is no
obvious relationship is with either x3 or x4.

The variables x3 and x4 show a more or less linear relationship, splitting into
two areas in the x3-x4 plane.
