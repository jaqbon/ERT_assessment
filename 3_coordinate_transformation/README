I implemented my own transformations, approximating the Earth as a sphere.

Defining

  C = cos(latitude)
  S = sin(latitude)

  c = cos(longitude)
  s = sin(longitude),

the radial unit vector is (in an xyz system)

  r = (Cc, Cs, S),

the north unit vector (tangent to the surface) is

  n = (-Sc, -Ss, C),

and the east unit vector is

  e = (-s, c, 0).


The unit tangent vector from point 1 to 2 is

  t = (r1 x (r2 x r1)) / |r1 x (r2 x r1)|

    = (r2 - r1(r1.r2)) / |r2 - r1(r1.r2)|

    = (r2 - r1(r1.r2)) / sqrt(1 - (r1.r2)^2).


The north and east components of the tangent vector are

  n.t = n.r2 / sqrt(1 - (r1.r2)^2),

  e.t = e.r2 / sqrt(1 - (r1.r2)^2).

(n.r1 and e.r1 are 0 since r, n and e are mutually orthogonal.)


The bearing from 1 to 2 is (the common 1/sqrt factor is irrelevant)

  atan2(e.t, n.t),

and the range is

  R acos(r1.r2),

where R is the radius of the Earth.


To go from range and bearing to r2, we use the projections

  r1.r2 (from range),

  n.r2 and e.r2 (from bearing),

on the mutually orthogonal r, n and e.



To go beyond the spherical approximation, I would implement the algorithm by Karney,
