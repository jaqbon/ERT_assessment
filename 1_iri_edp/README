Builds the shared library, calls Fortran from C. However, it's not returning good results.


Calling make with no options builds a library that should be put in the standard
library path (e.g. /lib). Calling with

  make LIBLOC=local

bakes-in the makefile's directory as the library location, so the executable can
be run from that location with no privileges.


To find the problem(s) with the bad returns, I'll need to stare at the Fortran,
and look at IRI documention. At this point, it's probably not worth the effort.
