Builds the shared library, calls Fortran from C. However, it's not returning good results.


Calling make with no options builds a library that should be put in the standard
library path (e.g. /lib). Calling with

  make LIBLOC=local

bakes-in the makefile's directory as the library location, so the executable can
be run from that location with no privileges.


Now working after finding my silly mistake. Writes two files for plotting
results from the specified dates and times.
