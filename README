Sorry to have taken so long. I did several of them quickly, but then had to
circle back to clean up and make plots. A few took a bit longer. ;)

I didn't do anything with the optimization problem, beyond a few Google searches
and some thinking. I'm familiar with the standard knapsack problem, and its
solution using dynamic programming, but this is obvously much harder. I'll leave
this one to the computer scientists.

Thanks for the opportunity to work on these interesting problems.
